**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Target Completion**: 2025-12-15 (6 weeks)
**Owner**: V√©rtice Platform Team

## üìä Current Status

### Coverage Summary (as of 2025-10-31)

| Tier | Coverage Range | Services | Status |
|------|----------------|----------|--------|
| üü¢ Excellent | ‚â•80% | 3 | ‚úÖ Ready for production |
| üü° Good | 60-79% | 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs minor improvement |
| üü† Needs Work | <60% | 2 | üö® Requires attention |
| ‚ö™ Unmeasured | TBD | 90 | üìä Measurement pending |

**Total Services**: 96
**Target**: 90%+ coverage on all critical services

---

## üéØ Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Measure & Prioritize (Week 1)
**Goal**: Get baseline coverage for all 90 unmeasured services

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (Week 2)
**Goal**: Bring services at 60-79% to 90%+

### Phase 3: Core Services (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Achieve 90%+ on all MAXIMUS, PENELOPE, MABA, MVP services

### Phase 4: Long Tail (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Achieve 70%+ on remaining services

---

## üìã Phase 1: Measure & Prioritize (Week 1)

### Objectives
1. Run coverage analysis on all 90 unmeasured services
2. Categorize by criticality (P0, P1, P2, P3)
3. Identify low-hanging fruit (services close to 90%)
4. Create prioritized backlog

### Actions

#### Day 1-2: Automated Coverage Scan
```bash
# Script to run coverage on all services
for service in backend/services/*/; do
  cd "$service"
  if [ -d "tests" ]; then
    pytest --cov=. --cov-report=json -q 2>/dev/null
    coverage=$(jq '.totals.percent_covered' coverage.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo "$service: $coverage%"
  fi
done > coverage_baseline.txt
```

**Deliverable**: `coverage_baseline.txt` with all services measured

#### Day 3: Service Criticality Matrix

| Priority | Criteria | Services (examples) |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **P0** | Core constitutional services | penelope, maba, mvp, maximus_core |
| **P1** | Security & immune systems | All immunis_*, offensive_*, threat_intel_* |
| **P2** | Brain & cognitive services | *_cortex_*, hippocampus, knowledge_graph |
| **P3** | Support services | mock_vulnerable_apps, test_service_* |

**Deliverable**: `service_criticality_matrix.csv`

#### Day 4-5: Gap Analysis & Planning

For each service, calculate:
- **Current Coverage**: From baseline scan
- **Target Coverage**: 90% (P0/P1), 70% (P2/P3)
- **Gap**: Target - Current
- **Estimated Effort**: Gap √ó Lines of Code √∑ 100
- **Priority Score**: Criticality √ó Gap

**Deliverable**: `coverage_gap_analysis.xlsx`

---

## üöÄ Phase 2: Quick Wins (Week 2)

### Target Services
Services already at 60-79% coverage (quick to push to 90%)

#### Current Candidates
1. **maximus_oraculo_v2** (69.1% ‚Üí 90%)
   - Gap: 20.9%
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days
   - High ROI: Large, critical service

### Strategy: Focus Testing

For services near 90%, identify uncovered modules:
```bash
cd backend/services/maximus_oraculo_v2
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
# Open htmlcov/index.html to see uncovered lines
```

### Test Creation Template

**Priority Order:**
1. **Happy path tests** (core functionality)
2. **Error handling tests** (exceptions, edge cases)
3. **Integration tests** (cross-module interactions)
4. **Edge case tests** (boundary conditions)

**Example Test Plan for maximus_oraculo_v2**:
```python
# tests/test_oraculo_core.py
def test_oracle_prediction_happy_path():
    """Test core prediction with valid input."""
    pass

def test_oracle_prediction_invalid_input():
    """Test error handling for invalid input."""
    pass

def test_oracle_prediction_empty_context():
    """Test edge case with empty context."""
    pass
```

**Deliverable**: Bring 3-5 services from 60-79% to 90%+

## üîß Phase 4: Long Tail (Weeks 5-6)

### Objectives
1. Achieve 70%+ on all P2 services
2. Achieve 60%+ on all P3 services
3. Document remaining gaps

### Approach: Batch Testing

Group similar services and create shared test utilities:

#### Batch 1: Immunis Services (7 services)
**Shared test utilities for immune cell services**
```python
# tests/shared/immunis_test_base.py
class ImmunisServiceTestBase:
    """Base test class for all immunis services."""

    def test_cell_activation(self):
        pass

    def test_cell_response(self):
        pass

    def test_cell_memory(self):
        pass
```

**Target**: 70%+ coverage on all 7 immunis services

#### Batch 2: HCL Services (5 services)
**Shared test utilities for HCL lifecycle services**
```python
# tests/shared/hcl_test_base.py
class HCLServiceTestBase:
    """Base test class for all HCL services."""

    def test_hcl_analysis(self):
        pass

    def test_hcl_execution(self):
        pass

    def test_hcl_monitoring(self):
        pass
```

**Target**: 70%+ coverage on all 5 HCL services

#### Batch 3: Offensive Suite (3 services)
**Shared test utilities for offensive tools**
```python
# tests/shared/offensive_test_base.py
class OffensiveToolTestBase:
    """Base test class for offensive services."""

    def test_tool_authorization(self):
        pass

    def test_tool_execution(self):
        pass

    def test_tool_reporting(self):
        pass
```

**Target**: 70%+ coverage on offensive suite

#### Batch 4: Brain Services (8 services)
**Shared test utilities for cortex services**
```python
# tests/shared/cortex_test_base.py
class CortexServiceTestBase:
    """Base test class for cortex services."""

    def test_sensory_input(self):
        pass

    def test_processing(self):
        pass

    def test_motor_output(self):
        pass
```

**Target**: 70%+ coverage on all brain services

#### Batch 5: Remaining Services (67 services)
**Focus on constitutional compliance only**

For low-priority services, maintain constitutional tests (5 tests):
- ‚úÖ Metrics endpoint
- ‚úÖ Health checks
- ‚úÖ P1 violations
- ‚úÖ Constitutional metrics

**Target**: 100% constitutional compliance (already achieved)

## üìä Success Metrics & Tracking

### Weekly Metrics

| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Services Measured | 96 | 96 | 96 | 96 | 96 | 96 |
| Avg Coverage | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | 85%+ |
| Services ‚â•90% | 3 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 35 | 40+ |
| Services ‚â•70% | 4 | 15 | 30 | 50 | 70 | 85+ |

### Tracking Dashboard

Create automated dashboard to track progress:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# coverage_dashboard.sh

echo "=== Coverage Dashboard ==="
echo ""
echo "P0 Services (Target: 90%+)"
for service in penelope_service maba_service mvp_service maximus_core_service; do
  coverage=$(get_coverage "$service")
  echo "$service: $coverage%"
done

echo ""
echo "P1 Services (Target: 90%+)"
# ... similar for P1

echo ""
echo "Overall Stats:"
echo "Average Coverage: $(calculate_average)%"
echo "Services ‚â•90%: $(count_90_plus)"
echo "Services ‚â•70%: $(count_70_plus)"
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Infrastructure

### Required Tools
1. **pytest** - Test runner
2. **pytest-cov** - Coverage measurement
3. **coverage.py** - Coverage data processing
4. **pytest-xdist** - Parallel test execution
5. **pytest-asyncio** - Async test support

### CI/CD Integration

Add coverage gates to CI pipeline:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage-gate.yml
name: Coverage Gate

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Coverage
        run: |
          pytest --cov=. --cov-report=json
          coverage=$(jq '.totals.percent_covered' coverage.json)
          if (( $(echo "$coverage < 70" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage $coverage% below 70% threshold"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Automated Test Generation

Use AI-assisted test generation for boilerplate:
```python
# scripts/generate_tests.py
def generate_test_suite(module_path):
    """Generate comprehensive test suite for module."""
    # Analyze module structure
    # Generate test cases
    # Write test file
    pass
```

|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Complex modules hard to test | High | Medium | Break into smaller units, use mocks |
| Legacy code without docs | Medium | High | Reverse engineer, add docs while testing |
| Time overrun | Medium | Medium | Prioritize P0/P1, defer P3 if needed |
| Test brittleness | Low | Medium | Use integration tests sparingly |
| Resource constraints | Low | High | Request additional support early |

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule after Week 3:**
- Drop P3 services to 50% target
- Focus exclusively on P0/P1 services
- Extend timeline by 2 weeks

**If critical service blocked:**
- Escalate immediately
- Pair programming with senior engineer
- Consider external consultation
