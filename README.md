## 🌟 What is Vértice-MAXIMUS?

**Vértice-MAXIMUS is not just software—it's a living cybersecurity organism.**

Inspired by the human immune system, Vértice-MAXIMUS employs a **9-layer biological defense cascade** that mirrors how your body fights infections. Instead of static rules, it **learns from every attack**, builds **immunological memory**, and **evolves** its defenses in real-time.

Just like white blood cells, neutrophils, and T-cells work together to protect your body, Vértice-MAXIMUS orchestrates **125+ specialized microservices** that act as digital immune cells, defending your infrastructure against modern threats.

### 🧬 Why Biological Architecture?

Traditional cybersecurity is reactive and rigid. **Biological systems are adaptive and resilient.**

| 🏥 Your Immune System | 🔺 Vértice-MAXIMUS |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Learns** from pathogens and builds memory | **Learns** from attacks and extracts IOCs |
| **Adapts** defenses based on threats | **Adapts** detection signatures dynamically |
| **Heals** damaged tissue autonomously | **Heals** compromised systems automatically |
| **Remembers** past infections for faster response | **Remembers** threat patterns in immunological memory |
| **Coordinates** multiple cell types (neutrophils, T-cells, B-cells) | **Coordinates** 125+ microservices (detectors, analyzers, responders) |

**The result?** A cybersecurity system that doesn't just detect threats—it **understands, remembers, and evolves** against them.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g vertice-maximus

# Initialize and configure
vertice init

# Start the immune system

- 🛡️ Defense layer selection
- 📊 Dashboard setup
- 🧪 First security scan

### Requirements

## 🧬 The Biological Defense Cascade

Vértice-MAXIMUS protects your infrastructure through **9 coordinated immune layers**, each responding at different timescales—just like your body:

### 1️⃣ Firewall (Tegumentar System) - `0-300ms`
🛡️ **Like your skin**: First barrier, blocks obvious threats at the perimeter.

### 2️⃣ Reflex Defense - `15-45ms`
⚡ **Like pulling your hand from fire**: Instant autonomous responses to known attack patterns.

### 3️⃣ Neutrophils (First Responders) - `2-4s`
🔵 **Like white blood cells**: Fast-acting detectors that swarm threats and begin neutralization.

### 4️⃣ Macrophages (Deep Analyzers) - `90-150s`
🔬 **Like immune scavengers**: Engulf malware, extract indicators, and present findings to adaptive layer.

### 5️⃣ Dendritic Cells (Threat Intel) - `500-900ms`
🧬 **Like intelligence officers**: Catalog threat patterns and activate adaptive responses.

### 6️⃣ T-Helper Cells (Coordinators) - `200-400ms`
🎯 **Like immune commanders**: Orchestrate multi-layer defense strategies based on threat type.

### 7️⃣ Adaptive Immune Response - `1-3s`
💉 **Like custom antibodies**: Generate YARA signatures, behavioral rules, and targeted countermeasures.

### 8️⃣ Immunological Memory - `2-10min`
🧠 **Like vaccination**: Store attack signatures for instant recognition on re-infection.

### 9️⃣ Consciousness (MAXIMUS AI) - `100-500ms`
✨ **Like your brain's decision-making**: Meta-cognitive oversight, threat actor profiling, strategic planning.
