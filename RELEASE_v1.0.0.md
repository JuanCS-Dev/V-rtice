## 🎉 Welcome to Vértice-MAXIMUS v1.0.0!

This is the **first public release** of Vértice-MAXIMUS - the world's first autonomous cybersecurity platform with biological immune system architecture.

**What is Vértice-MAXIMUS?**

Vértice-MAXIMUS is not just software—it's a **living cybersecurity organism**. Inspired by the human immune system, it employs a 9-layer biological defense cascade that learns, adapts, and evolves against threats in real-time.

Just like white blood cells, neutrophils, and T-cells work together to protect your body, Vértice-MAXIMUS orchestrates **125+ specialized microservices** that act as digital immune cells, defending your infrastructure against modern cyber threats.
