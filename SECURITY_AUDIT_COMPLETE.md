- ✅ `flake8` - Style enforcement
- ✅ `ruff` - Fast Python linter
- ✅ `mypy` - Type checking

**Security Linters**:
- ✅ `bandit` - Python security linter
- ✅ `safety` - CVE scanner for dependencies
- ✅ `pip-audit` - Official PyPA vulnerability scanner

**File Checks**:
- ✅ Large file detection (max 1MB)
- ✅ Merge conflict detection
- ✅ Trailing whitespace fixes
- ✅ YAML/JSON validation

**Docker & Shell**:
