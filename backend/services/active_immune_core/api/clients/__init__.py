"""
External service clients with graceful degradation.

This module provides clients for integrating with external services
in the VÃ©rtice ecosystem:
- Treg Service (Regulatory T-cells)
- Memory Consolidation Service
- Adaptive Immunity Service
- Governance Workspace (HITL)
- IP Intelligence Service

All clients implement graceful degradation and circuit breaker patterns.

NO MOCKS, NO PLACEHOLDERS, NO TODOS.
