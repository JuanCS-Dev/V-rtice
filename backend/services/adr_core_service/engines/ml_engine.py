"""Maximus ADR Core Service - Machine Learning Engine.

This module implements the Machine Learning (ML) Engine for the Automated
Detection and Response (ADR) service. It is responsible for applying advanced
ML models to security event data for tasks such as threat scoring, anomaly
detection, and predictive analysis.

The ML Engine integrates with various data sources, trains and deploys models,
and provides real-time insights to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of
threat detection and response. It leverages statistical and AI techniques to
identify subtle patterns indicative of malicious activity.
