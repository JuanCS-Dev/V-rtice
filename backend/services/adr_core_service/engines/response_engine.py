"""Maximus ADR Core Service - Response Engine.

This module implements the Response Engine for the Automated Detection and
Response (ADR) service. It is responsible for orchestrating and executing
automated response actions based on detected incidents and predefined playbooks.

The Response Engine interacts with various security tools and systems (e.g.,
firewalls, EDR, SIEM) to perform actions such as isolating compromised hosts,
blocking malicious IPs, terminating processes, or initiating forensic data
collection. It ensures that Maximus AI can take swift and decisive action to
mitigate threats.
