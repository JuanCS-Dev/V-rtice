"""Maximus ADR Core Service - Models Package.

This package defines the data models and schemas used throughout the Automated
Detection and Response (ADR) service. These models ensure data consistency,
facilitate validation, and provide a clear structure for representing security
events, detection results, incidents, response actions, and threat intelligence.

Modules within this package include:
- `enums`: Defines enumerations for various types (e.g., IncidentSeverity, DetectionType).
- `schemas`: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

These models are crucial for maintaining data integrity and enabling seamless
communication between different components of the ADR service and external systems.
