"""Maximus AI Immune System - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's self-defense
and resilience mechanisms, inspired by the biological immune system. It includes
modules for detecting anomalies, identifying threats, generating immune responses,
and learning from past attacks.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Monitoring the AI's internal state and external interactions for deviations.
- Classifying detected anomalies as potential threats.
- Orchestrating adaptive responses to neutralize threats and restore system integrity.
- Maintaining a memory of past threats and successful defenses to improve future resilience.
