"""Maximus AI Immune System - Adaptive Learning Module.

This module implements adaptive learning capabilities for the Maximus AI Immune
System. It is responsible for analyzing the outcomes of immune responses,
identifying successful strategies, and learning from failures to continuously
improve the AI's self-defense mechanisms.

By incorporating feedback from real-world incidents and simulated attacks,
this module allows Maximus to evolve its immune responses, adapt to new threats,
and optimize its resilience over time. This continuous learning process is
crucial for maintaining an effective and proactive defense against a dynamic
threat landscape.
