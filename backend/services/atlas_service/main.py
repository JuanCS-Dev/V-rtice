"""Maximus Atlas Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Atlas Service.
It initializes and configures the FastAPI application, sets up event handlers
for startup and shutdown, and defines the API endpoints for interacting with
the environmental mapping and situational awareness capabilities.

It orchestrates the ingestion of sensor data, the construction of environmental
models, and provides interfaces for other Maximus AI services to query and
understand the operational environment.
