"""Maximus Auditory Cortex Service - Binaural Correlation Module.

This module simulates binaural hearing and spatial sound localization within
the Maximus AI's Auditory Cortex. Inspired by how biological ears process sound
differences, this module analyzes subtle variations in audio signals received
from two (simulated) auditory inputs.

By correlating these differences (e.g., interaural time differences, interaural
level differences), Maximus can accurately determine the direction and distance
of sound sources in its environment. This capability is crucial for spatial
awareness, tracking moving objects, and enhancing the AI's ability to navigate
and interact with its surroundings based on auditory cues.
