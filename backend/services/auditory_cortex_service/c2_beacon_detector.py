"""Maximus Auditory Cortex Service - C2 Beacon Detector Module.

This module specializes in the auditory detection of Command and Control (C2)
beacons. C2 beacons are periodic, low-bandwidth communications from compromised
systems to an attacker's C2 server, often used to maintain persistence and
exfiltrate data.

This module processes audio data (e.g., from network taps, system microphones)
to identify subtle, recurring auditory patterns or electromagnetic emissions
that correspond to known C2 beacon signatures. By leveraging advanced signal
processing and pattern recognition, Maximus can detect these covert communications,
providing critical intelligence for cybersecurity defense and incident response.
