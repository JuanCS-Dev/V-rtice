"""Maximus BAS Service - Atomic Executor.

This module implements the Atomic Executor for the Breach and Attack Simulation
(BAS) service. It is responsible for executing individual, atomic attack
techniques against a target service or system component.

Each atomic technique represents a single, well-defined action that an attacker
might perform (e.g., port scan, credential stuffing, privilege escalation attempt).
The Atomic Executor ensures that these techniques are executed in a controlled
and isolated manner, allowing for precise measurement of their effectiveness
and the target's defensive response.
