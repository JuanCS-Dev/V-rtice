"""Maximus C2 Orchestration Service - API Endpoints.

This module defines the FastAPI application and its endpoints for the Command
and Control (C2) Orchestration Service. It exposes functionalities for managing
and coordinating the activities of various Maximus AI services, acting as a
central nervous system for complex operations.

Endpoints are provided for:
- Submitting high-level operational directives.
- Querying the status of ongoing orchestrated tasks.
- Retrieving results from completed operations.

This API allows external systems or human operators to issue commands and receive
updates on the execution of complex, multi-service operations within the Maximus
AI ecosystem.
