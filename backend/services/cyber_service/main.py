"""Maximus Cyber Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Cyber Service.
It initializes and configures the FastAPI application, sets up event handlers
for startup and shutdown, and defines the API endpoints for interacting with
the comprehensive cybersecurity capabilities.

It orchestrates the integration of various cybersecurity components, including
threat detection, vulnerability management, incident response, and proactive
defense mechanisms, to provide a unified and intelligent cybersecurity solution
for the Maximus AI system.
