"""Maximus Digital Thalamus Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Digital
Thalamus Service. Inspired by the biological thalamus, this service acts as a
central relay station for sensory information, routing critical data to the
appropriate cortical services for processing.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Ingesting raw data from various sensory services (visual, auditory, chemical, somatosensory).
- Filtering, prioritizing, and pre-processing sensory inputs.
- Directing processed sensory data to higher-level cognitive services.
- Ensuring efficient and timely delivery of essential information for perception and decision-making.
