"""Maximus HCL Executor Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Homeostatic
Control Loop (HCL) Executor Service. It is responsible for executing resource
alignment plans generated by the HCL Planner Service. It interacts with underlying
system APIs (e.g., Docker SDK, Kubernetes API, OS-level controls) to make
real-time adjustments to the AI's operational environment.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Translating high-level resource plans into concrete, actionable commands.
- Interfacing with infrastructure-as-code tools or cloud provider APIs.
- Monitoring the execution of adjustments and reporting their outcomes.
- Ensuring that the decisions made by the HCL are translated into concrete actions,
  maintaining system stability and performance.
