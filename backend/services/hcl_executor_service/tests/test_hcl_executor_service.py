"""Unit tests for HCL Executor Service.

DOUTRINA VÃ‰RTICE - ARTIGO II: PAGANI Standard
Tests cover actual production implementation:
- Health check endpoint
- Plan execution with action executor
- Kubernetes status endpoint
- Execution status aggregation (completed vs completed_with_errors)
- Request validation
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

Note: ActionExecutor and KubernetesController are mocked in tests to isolate
executor service logic (test infrastructure mocking, not production code).
