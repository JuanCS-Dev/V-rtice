"""Maximus Homeostatic Regulation Service - API Endpoints.

This module defines the FastAPI application and its endpoints for the Homeostatic
Regulation Service. It exposes functionalities for managing and observing the
Maximus AI's Homeostatic Control Loop (HCL).

Endpoints are provided for:
- Retrieving the current operational status and health of the HCL.
- Submitting operational goals or policy updates.
- Triggering emergency red-line responses.

This API allows other Maximus AI services or external systems to interact with
the HCL, enabling dynamic adaptation, performance optimization, and proactive
management of the entire Maximus AI system.
