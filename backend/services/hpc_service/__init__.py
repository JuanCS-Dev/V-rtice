"""Maximus HPC Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's High-Performance
Computing (HPC) Service. It is responsible for managing and orchestrating access
to specialized computing resources, such as GPUs, FPGAs, or distributed clusters,
to accelerate computationally intensive tasks.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Allocating and deallocating HPC resources based on demand.
- Scheduling and executing parallel processing jobs.
- Optimizing algorithms for high-throughput and low-latency execution.
- Providing a scalable and efficient computing backbone for Maximus AI's most
  demanding cognitive and analytical processes.
