"""Maximus HPC Service - Active Inference Engine.

This module implements the Active Inference Engine for the Maximus AI's
High-Performance Computing (HPC) Service. Active inference is a theoretical
framework that describes how biological systems maintain their existence by
minimizing 'free energy' or prediction error, actively seeking out information
that reduces uncertainty about their environment.

In Maximus, this engine drives autonomous threat hunting and proactive security
operations. It uses the Bayesian Core to generate predictions and then actively
selects actions (e.g., scanning, probing, data collection) that are expected to
minimize prediction error, thereby improving its model of the environment and
detecting novel threats. This module is crucial for Maximus AI's self-directed
exploration and adaptive security posture.
