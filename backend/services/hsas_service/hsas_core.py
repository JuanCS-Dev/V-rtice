"""Maximus HSAS Service - Human-System Alignment Core.

This module implements the core logic for the Maximus AI's Human-System
Alignment Service (HSAS). It is responsible for continuously evaluating and
adjusting the AI's behavior to ensure alignment with human values, intentions,
and ethical guidelines.

Key functionalities include:
- Processing human feedback and preferences to update alignment models.
- Detecting potential misalignments or ethical conflicts in AI decisions.
- Generating explanations for AI actions to promote transparency.
- Providing mechanisms for human oversight and intervention.

This core is crucial for building trust, ensuring responsible AI deployment,
and facilitating beneficial human-AI collaboration within the Maximus AI system.
