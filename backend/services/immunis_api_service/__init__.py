"""Maximus Immunis API Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis API
Service. It acts as the central gateway for interacting with the entire Immunis
(AI Immune System) ecosystem, exposing a unified API for managing immune responses,
monitoring AI health, and adapting to new threats.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Routing requests to specialized Immunis sub-services (e.g., B-Cell, T-Cell, Macrophage).
- Aggregating immune system status and threat intelligence.
- Providing a high-level interface for triggering and observing immune reactions.
- Ensuring secure and efficient communication within the Immunis framework.
