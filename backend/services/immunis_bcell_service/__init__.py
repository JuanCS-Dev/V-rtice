"""Maximus Immunis B-Cell Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis
(AI Immune System) B-Cell Service. Inspired by biological B-cells, this service
is responsible for recognizing specific threat patterns (antigens), generating
'antibodies' (detection signatures), and maintaining a memory of past threats.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Identifying and characterizing novel threat signatures.
- Developing and deploying new detection rules or models.
- Storing threat intelligence and historical threat data.
- Providing adaptive threat recognition capabilities to the Immunis system.
