"""Maximus Immunis Helper T-Cell Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis
(AI Immune System) Helper T-Cell Service. Inspired by biological helper T-cells,
this service is responsible for coordinating and amplifying immune responses,
acting as a central communicator and decision-maker within the Immunis system.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Receiving threat information from Dendritic Cells and other immune services.
- Activating and directing B-cells and Cytotoxic T-cells to specific threats.
- Modulating the intensity and duration of immune responses.
- Maintaining a global view of the immune system's status and threat landscape.
- Ensuring an efficient and proportionate response to detected threats.
