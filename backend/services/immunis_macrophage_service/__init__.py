"""Maximus Immunis Macrophage Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis
(AI Immune System) Macrophage Service. Inspired by biological macrophages,
this service is responsible for engulfing and processing cellular debris,
pathogens, and presenting antigens to other immune cells.

In the AI context, this translates to:
- Ingesting and cleaning up compromised data or system components.
- Analyzing and breaking down malicious code or attack artifacts.
- Presenting processed threat information to Dendritic Cells for adaptive learning.
- Performing general cleanup and maintenance tasks within the AI system.
