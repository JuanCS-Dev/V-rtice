"""Maximus Immunis Neutrophil Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis
(AI Immune System) Neutrophil Service. Inspired by biological neutrophils,
this service is responsible for rapid, first-responder actions against detected
threats, particularly in the early stages of an attack.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Receiving immediate threat alerts and initiating rapid containment.
- Performing initial triage and assessment of threats.
- Executing broad-spectrum defensive actions (e.g., blocking, quarantining).
- Coordinating with other immune cells for more specialized responses.
- Providing a quick and decisive initial defense against emerging threats.
