"""Maximus Immunis NK-Cell Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Immunis
(AI Immune System) Natural Killer (NK) Cell Service. Inspired by biological
NK cells, this service is responsible for detecting and eliminating compromised
or anomalous entities that lack proper identification or exhibit abnormal behavior,
without prior sensitization.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Continuously monitoring system components for signs of compromise or anomaly.
- Identifying entities that deviate from normal operational baselines.
- Executing rapid, non-specific elimination or containment actions.
- Providing an innate, first-line defense against novel or rapidly evolving threats.
