# Demonstration Code

⚠️ **WARNING: THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS DEMONSTRATION/MOCK CODE ONLY**

## Purpose

This directory contains demonstration, proof-of-concept, and integration code that uses **mock implementations** instead of real functionality. These files are **NOT production-ready** and should NOT be deployed.

## Files in this directory

### Mock/Demonstration Implementations
- `tools_world_class.py` - Mock tool implementations (search_web, get_current_weather)
- `chain_of_thought.py` - Mock chain-of-thought reasoning
- `reasoning_engine.py` - Mock reasoning engine
- `rag_system.py` - Wrapper for vector DB (depends on mock VectorDBClient)
- `vector_db_client.py` - Mock vector database client (uses in-memory dict)

### Integration/Orchestration (uses mocks above)
- `maximus_integrated.py` - Integration of all Maximus components (uses mock components)
- `apply_maximus.py` - Orchestrator for Maximus AI (uses mock components)
- `all_services_tools.py` - Tool registry (uses mock WorldClassTools)

### Tests
- `test_world_class_tools.py` - Tests for demonstration tools

## Why these files are NOT production-ready

1. **Mock implementations**: Return hardcoded/simulated data instead of real results
2. **"In a real scenario" comments**: Explicit placeholders for real functionality
3. **No external integrations**: Don't actually call APIs, databases, or external services
4. **REGRA DE OURO violations**: Violate the "no mock, no placeholder" rule

## Production-ready modules

The following modules in the parent directory ARE production-ready:

### ✅ Production-Ready Modules (REGRA DE OURO compliant)
- `ethics/` - Multi-framework ethical reasoning (Kant, Virtue, Consequentialist, Principlism)
- `xai/` - Explainable AI (LIME, SHAP, counterfactuals, drift detection)
- `governance/` - HITL workflows, ERB, policy enforcement, audit trails
- `fairness/` - Bias detection and fairness metrics
- `privacy/` - Differential privacy mechanisms
- `hitl/` - Human-in-the-loop decision queues
- `compliance/` - Multi-regulation compliance checking (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- `federated_learning/` - FedAvg, secure aggregation
- `performance/` - Quantization, profiling, benchmarking
- `training/` - GPU training with DDP and AMP
- `autonomic_core/` - MAPE-K control loop
- `attention_system/` - Salience scoring
- `neuromodulation/` - Neuromodulator systems
- `predictive_coding/` - 5-layer hierarchy
- `skill_learning/` - Experience-based learning

## Usage

These demonstration files can be used for:
- Understanding system architecture
- Prototyping new integrations
- Educational purposes
- Testing component interactions

**DO NOT use in production deployments.**

## REGRA DE OURO Compliance

Moving these files to `_demonstration/` ensures the production codebase maintains **REGRA DE OURO 10/10** compliance:
- ✅ Zero mocks in production code
- ✅ Zero placeholders in production code
- ✅ Zero NotImplementedError in production code
- ✅ 100% production-ready functionality in production directories
