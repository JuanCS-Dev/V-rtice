## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Timeline Slippage
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Phases 0-1 immediately (constitutional safety)
- Parallelize Phase 2 work across engineers
- Use test templates to accelerate
- Focus on critical paths first

### Risk 2: Test Quality Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Peer review all tests
- Require assertions on critical behaviors
- Use mutation testing to validate test effectiveness
- Regular test review sessions

### Risk 3: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:**
- Stick to 70% coverage target for Phase 4
- Defer Tier 4 utilities to future sprints
- Focus on deployment blockers only
- Document "nice-to-have" tests for later

### Risk 4: Integration Complexity
**Mitigation:**
- Build E2E tests incrementally
- Test component boundaries first
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Validate with stakeholders frequently

---

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Today:** Present this plan to leadership, get approval
2. **Tomorrow:** Form testing task force (3-5 engineers)
3. **Day 3-5:** Complete Phase 0 (Emergency Stabilization)
4. **Week 2:** Begin Phase 1 (Constitutional Safety)

---

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Daily
- Coverage percentage (track trend)
- Tests passing vs failing
- New tests added

### Weekly
- Phase completion %
- Blockers identified
- Timeline adjustments

### Monthly
- Overall coverage milestone
- Deployment readiness assessment
- Risk review

---

## Conclusion

MAXIMUS is currently at **5.25% coverage** - a **critical risk** for production deployment. This plan provides a systematic path to **70%+ coverage** over **4-6 months** (or 5-8 weeks with adequate resourcing).

**Key Priorities:**
1. **Constitutional safety** (Tier 0) - IMMEDIATE
2. **Consciousness reliability** (Tier 1) - CRITICAL
3. **Integration validation** (E2E) - REQUIRED
4. **HITL functionality** (Lei I) - BLOCKER

**Recommendation:** Allocate 3-5 engineers full-time for 6-8 weeks to achieve deployment-ready state.
