"""Maximus Core Service - Homeostatic Control Loop (HCL).

This module implements the Homeostatic Control Loop, a core component of the
Autonomic Core. Inspired by biological homeostatic systems, the HCL continuously
monitors the AI's operational environment, analyzes its state, plans resource
adjustments, and executes those plans to maintain optimal performance and stability.

It operates as a MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute-Knowledge) loop, ensuring
self-regulation and adaptive behavior.
