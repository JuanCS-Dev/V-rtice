"""Maximus Core Service - Resource Planner.

This module is responsible for generating resource allocation plans based on the
system's current state and analysis. It utilizes a real-time fuzzy logic
controller, inspired by industrial control systems, to make adaptive decisions
about scaling, optimization, and operational modes.

The Resource Planner translates high-level analysis into concrete, actionable
steps for the Resource Executor, ensuring the AI's operational efficiency and
responsiveness.
