"""Maximus Core Service - Confidence Scoring Module.

This module is responsible for evaluating and assigning a confidence score to
the responses generated by the Maximus AI. The confidence score reflects the
AI's certainty in the accuracy, completeness, and relevance of its output,
based on various internal metrics and contextual factors.

By providing a confidence score, Maximus can communicate its level of certainty
to users or downstream systems, enabling more informed decision-making and
facilitating adaptive behavior in uncertain situations.
