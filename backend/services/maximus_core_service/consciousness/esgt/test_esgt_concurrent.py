ESGT Concurrent Ignition Blocking Tests
========================================

Tests winner-take-all dynamics for concurrent ignition attempts.

Theoretical Foundation:
-----------------------
Global Workspace Theory proposes that consciousness exhibits winner-take-all
competition: only one coherent state can dominate the global workspace at a time.

When multiple stimuli compete for conscious access:
1. **Competition**: Multiple local processors signal high salience
2. **Selection**: Strongest signal wins based on salience + context
3. **Suppression**: Losing signals are inhibited
4. **Serialization**: Conscious states are sequential, not parallel

ESGT Implementation:
--------------------
- Only ONE active ESGT event at a time
- Concurrent attempts during active ESGT are blocked or queued
- Priority-based selection when multiple high-salience events compete
- Clean transitions between conscious states

IIT/GWT Relevance:
------------------
**IIT**: Consciousness is unified (one integrated system, not parallel)
**GWT**: Global workspace can only broadcast one content at a time
**Biology**: Cortical states show winner-take-all dynamics in attention

"Consciousness is a serial bottleneck in parallel processing."
