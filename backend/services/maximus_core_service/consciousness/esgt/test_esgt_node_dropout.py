"""
ESGT Node Dropout Scenario Tests
=================================

Tests ESGT resilience when TIG nodes fail or drop out.

Theoretical Foundation:
-----------------------
Biological brains tolerate neuron death - consciousness doesn't vanish when
individual neurons die. Distributed processing with redundancy enables resilience.

Node Dropout Scenarios:
-----------------------
1. **During ignition**: Node fails mid-ESGT
2. **Broadcast failure**: Node can't receive/send
3. **Below quorum**: Too few nodes for consensus
4. **Recovery**: Node returns after dropout
5. **Cascading**: Multiple nodes fail

Consciousness Implications:
---------------------------
**IIT**: Reduced integration (fewer nodes) → lower Φ, but not zero
**GWT**: Partial workspace still functional if quorum maintained
**Redundancy**: Non-degeneracy means no single point of failure

Biological Analogy:
-------------------
- Stroke: Localized damage, gradual compensation
- Anesthesia: Reversible node "dropout"
- Sleep: Reduced node participation
- Recovery: Plasticity and re-recruitment

"Consciousness is fault-tolerant by design."
