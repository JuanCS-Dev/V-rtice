## How to Resume Tomorrow

### Option 1: Check Test Results
```bash
# Check if tests are still running
ps aux | grep pytest | grep -v grep

# If done, check outputs:
ls -lah tests/statistical/outputs/

# Read final summary (if tests completed):
cat tests/statistical/outputs/DAY1_FINAL_SUMMARY.md
```

### Option 2: Run Monitoring Script
```bash
# If tests still running, monitor them:
./scripts/monitor_tests_day1.sh

# Or run in background:
nohup ./scripts/monitor_tests_day1.sh > /tmp/monitor_day1.log 2>&1 &
```

### Option 3: Continue Where We Left Off
```bash
# Re-run coverage for specific modules:
python -m pytest consciousness/esgt/ --cov=consciousness/esgt --cov-report=html

# Or continue with next priority (sensory cortices):
# Check diagnostic: docs/FASE4_CONSCIOUSNESS_DIAGNOSTIC.md
# Follow roadmap: Priority 1 tasks
```

---

## Tomorrow's Plan (Day 2)

**Focus:** ESGT/MMEI/MCEA completion + Sensory audit
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Goal:** Reach 30-40% overall coverage

**Tasks:**
1. Review results from today's tests (prefrontal + ESGT/MMEI/MCEA)
2. Audit sensory cortices for hidden tests
3. Create tests for true gaps (if any)
4. Update progress report
5. Plan Day 3 priorities

## Final Notes

**What Went Well:**
- Discovered excellent hidden test coverage (202 neuromodulation tests!)
- Clean baseline established (22 legacy tests archived)
- Comprehensive documentation created
- Clear roadmap for next 7-10 days

**What to Improve:**
- Initial coverage report was misleading (need better discovery)
- Some sensory cortex files not found (may be in different location)
- Could parallelize more test runs

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH**
- Timeline to 95% coverage: Achievable in 7-10 days
- Quality of existing tests: Excellent
- Documentation: Comprehensive
