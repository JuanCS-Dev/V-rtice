Article V Guardian - Prior Legislation Enforcement

Enforces Article V of the VÃ©rtice Constitution: The Principle of Prior Legislation.
Ensures governance systems are implemented BEFORE autonomous systems of power.

Key Enforcement Areas:
- Section 1: Governance must be designed/implemented before autonomous systems
- Section 2: Responsibility Doctrine must be applied to all autonomous AI workflows
