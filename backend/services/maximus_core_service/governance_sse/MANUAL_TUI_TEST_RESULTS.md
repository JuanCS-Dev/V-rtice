### T+17s: Decision Approval Action
```
16:41:12 - Decision approved: test_dec_20251006_193607
         - Operator: juan@juan-Linux-Mint-Vertice
         - Action result: executed=False (expected - no real firewall executor)
         - Decision removed from queue
```
✅ **PASS** - Approval action processed successfully
⚠️ **NOTE:** Execution failed due to missing `block_ip` executor (expected behavior for testing)

         - Queue monitor stopped
         - Heartbeat loop stopped (no active connections)
```
✅ **PASS** - Graceful shutdown on TUI exit

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Validation

### ✅ Visual Layout (3-Panel Design)

## 🔍 Events Sent to TUI (6 total)

Based on SSE server logs, the following events were broadcast:

1. **`connected`** - Welcome event on SSE connection
2. **`decision_pending`** - test_dec_20251006_193607 enqueued
3. **`heartbeat`** (multiple) - Keep-alive pings every 30s
4. **`decision_resolved`** (implicit) - After approval

## 🐛 Issues Encountered

### ⚠️ Expected Issue: No Executor for block_ip
**Log:**
```
[ERROR] Execution failed for test_dec_20251006_193607:
        No executor registered for action type: block_ip
```

**Analysis:**
- This is **expected behavior** for E2E testing
- `HITLDecisionFramework` requires real action executors (firewall, IDS, etc.)
- For testing purposes, decision is approved with `executed=False`
- In production, executors would be registered for each `ActionType`

**Impact:** ❌ None - Test environment limitation, not a bug

**Recommendation:**
- Document executor registration in production deployment guide
- Consider adding mock executor for testing (or accept `executed=False`)
