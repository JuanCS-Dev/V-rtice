"""Maximus Core Service - Reasoning Engine.

This module constitutes the core cognitive component of the Maximus AI, responsible
for processing information, making decisions, and generating coherent responses.
It leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning
tasks, synthesize information from various sources, and formulate intelligent
outputs.

The Reasoning Engine integrates inputs from the memory system, RAG system, and
tool orchestrator, applying a sophisticated understanding of context and intent
to produce high-quality, relevant, and actionable responses.
