"""Maximus Core Service - Self-Reflection Module.

This module enables the Maximus AI to critically evaluate its own outputs,
reasoning processes, and tool interactions. By performing self-reflection,
Maximus can identify potential errors, biases, or areas for improvement in its
responses, leading to more accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate
outputs.

This capability is crucial for enhancing the AI's autonomy and reliability,
allowing it to learn from its own operations and continuously refine its
performance without constant external intervention.
