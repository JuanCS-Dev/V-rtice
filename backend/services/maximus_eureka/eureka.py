"""Maximus Eureka Service - Eureka Engine.

This module implements the core Eureka Engine for the Maximus AI. Inspired by
the concept of a eureka moment, this engine is responsible for identifying novel
insights, making unexpected connections, and generating breakthrough discoveries
from vast amounts of data.

Key functionalities include:
- Applying advanced analytical techniques (e.g., graph analysis, statistical anomaly detection,
  machine learning for pattern recognition) to uncover hidden patterns.
- Cross-referencing information from disparate data sources (e.g., logs, threat intel, sensor data).
- Generating hypotheses about observed phenomena and testing them against available evidence.
- Communicating novel discoveries and their implications to other Maximus AI services
  for strategic planning, problem-solving, and adaptive behavior.
