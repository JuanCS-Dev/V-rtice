"""Maximus Eureka Service - Playbook Generator.

This module implements a Playbook Generator for the Maximus AI's Eureka Service.
It is responsible for dynamically creating or suggesting response playbooks based
on novel insights, detected patterns, or critical discoveries made by the Eureka
Engine.

By leveraging the insights gained from deep data analysis, this module can
propose tailored, actionable sequences of defensive or investigative steps.
This capability enhances Maximus AI's ability to translate raw intelligence
into concrete operational plans, bridging the gap between discovery and response,
and supporting adaptive security and operational strategies.
