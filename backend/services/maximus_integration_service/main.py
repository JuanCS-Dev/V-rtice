"""Maximus Integration Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Integration Service.
It initializes and configures the FastAPI application, sets up event handlers
for startup and shutdown, and defines the API endpoints for facilitating
communication and data exchange between various Maximus AI services and external
systems.

It handles API connections, data translation, and workflow orchestration,
providing a unified interface for Maximus AI to interact with the broader
digital ecosystem. This service is crucial for enabling Maximus to leverage
external tools, data sources, and services, extending its capabilities and
operational reach.
