"""Maximus Oraculo Service - Suggestion Generator.

This module implements the Suggestion Generator for the Maximus AI's Oraculo
Service. It is responsible for formulating actionable recommendations, strategic
insights, and potential solutions based on the predictive analysis and guidance
provided by the Oraculo Engine.

Key functionalities include:
- Translating complex analytical results into clear, concise, and actionable suggestions.
- Considering operational goals, constraints, and ethical guidelines during suggestion generation.
- Prioritizing suggestions based on their potential impact and feasibility.
- Providing tailored recommendations to other Maximus AI services or human operators
  to optimize decision-making and achieve desired outcomes.
