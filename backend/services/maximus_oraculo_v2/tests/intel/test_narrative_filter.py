🧪 NARRATIVE FILTER TESTS - Intelligence Layer
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEST PHILOSOPHY:
- TDD: Tests define behavior BEFORE implementation
- Coverage: ≥90% line coverage, ≥80% branch coverage
- Real CVE samples: Use actual CVE descriptions from NVD
- Edge cases: Empty, None, unicode, very long descriptions

TEST CATEGORIES:
1. Hype Detection: Low exploitability, unrealistic conditions
2. Weaponization Detection: Active exploits, RCE, zero-click
3. Neutral Baseline: Standard CVE language
4. Edge Cases: Malformed inputs, unicode, performance
5. Integration: Filter decision logic
