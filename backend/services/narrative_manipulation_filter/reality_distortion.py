"""Maximus Narrative Manipulation Filter - Reality Distortion Detector.

This module implements a Reality Distortion Detector for the Maximus AI's
Narrative Manipulation Filter. It is responsible for identifying content that
attempts to create a false or misleading perception of reality, often through
selective presentation of facts, omission of context, or outright fabrication.

Key functionalities include:
- Cross-referencing claims against trusted knowledge bases and factual sources.
- Detecting inconsistencies or logical contradictions within a narrative.
- Analyzing the framing and context of information to identify deceptive practices.
- Assessing the potential impact of distorted narratives on the AI's understanding
  of the environment.

This detector is crucial for maintaining the integrity of Maximus AI's world model,
protecting it from being misled by manipulated information, and ensuring its
decisions are based on an accurate understanding of reality.
