"""Maximus Network Reconnaissance Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Network
Reconnaissance Service. It is responsible for actively gathering information
about target networks, systems, and services to identify potential attack
surfaces, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Performing various reconnaissance techniques (e.g., port scanning, banner grabbing, OS fingerprinting).
- Discovering network topology and active hosts.
- Identifying open ports, running services, and their versions.
- Providing detailed reconnaissance reports to other Maximus AI services for
  threat assessment, vulnerability management, and offensive operations.
