"""Maximus Network Reconnaissance Service - Masscan Wrapper.

This module provides a wrapper for integrating the Maximus AI's Network
Reconnaissance Service with Masscan. Masscan is a fast internet port scanner
that can scan the entire internet in under 6 minutes, making it ideal for
high-speed, large-scale network discovery.

This wrapper allows Maximus to programmatically initiate Masscan scans,
parse their output, and retrieve information about open ports across vast
IP ranges. It is crucial for rapid asset discovery, identifying exposed services,
and building a comprehensive understanding of the network attack surface.
