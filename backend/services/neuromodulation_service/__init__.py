"""Maximus Neuromodulation Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Neuromodulation
Service. Inspired by biological neuromodulation, this service is responsible
for dynamically adjusting the AI's internal states, cognitive biases, and
processing parameters to optimize its performance for specific tasks or
environmental conditions.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Receiving contextual cues and operational goals.
- Modulating AI parameters such as attention, learning rate, and decision thresholds.
- Adapting the AI's emotional or motivational states (simulated).
- Providing a flexible mechanism for fine-tuning Maximus AI's cognitive functions,
  enabling it to adapt its behavior and optimize its effectiveness in real-time.
