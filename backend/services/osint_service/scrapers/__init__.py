"""Maximus OSINT Service - Scrapers Package.

This package contains specialized modules for scraping and collecting open-source
intelligence (OSINT) data from various public platforms and sources. These
scrapers are responsible for programmatically accessing websites, social media,
forums, and other online resources to gather relevant information.

Modules within this package include:
- `base_scraper`: Provides a base class or interface for all scrapers.
- `social_scraper`: Collects data from social media platforms.
- `username_hunter`: Searches for information associated with a given username.
- `discord_bot`: Interacts with Discord for data collection.

These scrapers are crucial for the initial data collection phase of OSINT
investigations, providing the raw input for subsequent analysis and intelligence
generation.
