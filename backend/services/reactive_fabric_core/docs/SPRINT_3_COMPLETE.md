## Test Summary

```
Total Tests: 117
Passed: 117
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100%

Overall Coverage: 79.14%
```

### Component Coverage Breakdown:
- Log Aggregation Collector: 100%
- Threat Intelligence Collector: 90%
- Orchestration Engine: 98.74%
- Deception Engine: 94.72%
- HITL Integration: 93.31%

## Phase 1 Compliance

All components strictly adhere to Phase 1 requirements:
- **PASSIVE operation only** - no automated responses
- All decisions are logged but not executed
- Human approval required for all actions
- Deception elements deployed but only for detection
- No active countermeasures or system modifications

## Key Achievements

1. **100% Test Pass Rate**: All 117 tests passing across all components
2. **High Code Coverage**: Average >90% coverage per component
3. **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Full mapping of tactics and techniques
4. **Multi-Backend Support**: 3 log aggregation backends, 4 threat intel sources
5. **Async Architecture**: Non-blocking I/O for high performance
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Edge cases, error handling, integration tests

## Architecture Highlights

### Collector Architecture
- Abstract base class for consistency
- Async generators for streaming data
- Health monitoring and metrics
- Graceful error handling

### Event Flow
1. Collectors gather data from various sources
2. Orchestration engine correlates events
3. Patterns trigger threat scoring
4. Deception elements detect intrusions
5. HITL interface presents alerts for human decision
6. All actions logged but not executed (Phase 1)

### Security Patterns Detected
- Reconnaissance (port scanning, enumeration)
- Credential Access (brute force, password attacks)
- Privilege Escalation (sudo attempts, UAC bypass)
- Lateral Movement (RDP, SSH connections)
- Exfiltration (large data transfers)
- Command & Control (beaconing, callbacks)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

When Phase 2 is approved, the following capabilities can be enabled:
- Automated response execution
- Active deception engagement
- Real-time threat mitigation
- Autonomous decision making (with safeguards)
- Integration with security orchestration platforms
