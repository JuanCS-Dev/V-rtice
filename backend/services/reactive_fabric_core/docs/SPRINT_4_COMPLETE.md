```

## Response Plan Example

### Critical Threat: Data Exfiltration
**Threat Score**: 0.9
**Entities**: `{ip: "10.0.0.100", hostname: "infected-host"}`

**Automated Response Plan**:
1. **Critical Priority** (Parallel):
   - Block IP address (reversible, 60 min)
   - Isolate host from network (reversible)
   - Activate kill switch (requires approval)
   - Enable data diode outbound (reversible)

2. **High Priority** (Sequential):
   - Update firewall rules
   - Deploy honeypot
   - Trigger backup

3. **Medium Priority**:
   - Rotate credentials
   - Alert SOC team

## Safety Features

### Pre-Execution Checks
1. ✅ System stability verification
2. ✅ No conflicting actions in progress
3. ✅ Resource availability
4. ✅ Business hours compliance (non-critical)
5. ✅ Dual approval verification (if enabled)

### Rollback Capabilities
- All reversible actions tracked
- Automatic rollback on failure (configurable)
- Manual rollback support
- State restoration
- Rollback verification

## Integration Points

### Existing Components
- **Firewall** (`isolation/firewall.py`)
- **Kill Switch** (`isolation/kill_switch.py`)
- **Network Segmentation** (`isolation/network_segmentation.py`)
- **Data Diode** (`isolation/data_diode.py`)

### Integration Method
```python
orchestrator = ResponseOrchestrator(config)
orchestrator.firewall = NetworkFirewall()
orchestrator.kill_switch = KillSwitch()
orchestrator.network_segmentation = NetworkSegmentation()
orchestrator.data_diode = DataDiode()
```
