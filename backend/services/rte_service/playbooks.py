"""Maximus RTE Service - Real-Time Playbooks.

This module implements Real-Time Playbooks for the Maximus AI's Real-Time
Execution (RTE) Service. These playbooks define a series of rapid, automated
actions and decision points for responding to critical, time-sensitive events
or threats.

Key functionalities include:
- Defining predefined sequences of actions for specific real-time scenarios.
- Integrating with Fast ML for rapid decision-making and Hyperscan for pattern matching.
- Executing actions with guaranteed low latency against system resources.
- Providing a robust and responsive mechanism for Maximus AI to react
  instantaneously to dynamic environmental changes or emerging threats.

This module is crucial for enabling Maximus AI to perform immediate defensive
or operational maneuvers, minimizing impact and ensuring system integrity in
high-stakes situations.
