"""Maximus Seriema Graph Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Seriema Graph
Service. Inspired by the Seriema bird's ability to navigate complex terrains,
this service is responsible for building, managing, and querying a dynamic
knowledge graph that represents the relationships between various entities
within the AI's operational environment.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Ingesting structured and unstructured data to populate the graph.
- Identifying entities (e.g., IPs, users, processes) and their connections.
- Performing complex graph queries for relationship discovery and pattern matching.
- Providing a contextual understanding of interconnected entities to other Maximus
  AI services for threat intelligence, incident response, and strategic planning.
