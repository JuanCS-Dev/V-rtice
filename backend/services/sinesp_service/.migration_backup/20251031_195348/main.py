"""Maximus Sinesp Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Sinesp Service.
It initializes and configures the FastAPI application, sets up event handlers
for startup and shutdown, and defines the API endpoints for querying Sinesp
data and performing AI-driven analysis.

It orchestrates the integration with the Sinesp CidadÃ£o API, processes the
retrieved public security data, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM)
to extract relevant intelligence and provide contextual insights. This service
is crucial for supporting investigations, situational awareness, and law
enforcement support within the Maximus AI system.
