"""Maximus Sinesp Service - Data Models.

This module defines the Pydantic data models (schemas) used for data validation
and serialization within the Sinesp Service. These schemas ensure data consistency
and provide a clear structure for representing Sinesp queries, vehicle information,
and other public security-related data.

By using Pydantic, Maximus AI benefits from automatic data validation, clear
documentation of data structures, and seamless integration with FastAPI for
API request and response modeling. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity
and enabling efficient data exchange within the Sinesp integration ecosystem.
