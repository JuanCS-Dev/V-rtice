"""Maximus Somatosensory Service - Mechanoreceptors Module.

This module simulates the function of mechanoreceptors, which are sensory
receptors responsible for detecting mechanical stimuli such as pressure,
vibration, and texture. In Maximus AI, this translates to processing data
from simulated touch sensors to understand physical interactions.

The Mechanoreceptors module provides Maximus with a sense of 'touch', allowing
it to perceive the physical properties of objects and surfaces it interacts with.
This data is crucial for tasks requiring fine motor control, object manipulation,
and understanding the physical environment.
