# System Architect Service

**Macro-level architectural analysis for VÉRTICE cybersecurity platform**

## Overview

The System Architect Service provides comprehensive product-level analysis of the entire VÉRTICE platform, identifying gaps, redundancies, optimization opportunities, and generating executive reports for deployment decisions.

## Features

- **Architecture Scanning**: Analyzes all 89+ microservices
- **Integration Analysis**: Maps Kafka, Redis, and HTTP communication patterns
- **Redundancy Detection**: Identifies overlapping services and consolidation opportunities
- **Deployment Optimization**: Suggests Kubernetes migrations and best practices
- **Report Generation**: Executive reports in JSON, Markdown, and HTML

### Get Latest Report
```bash
GET /reports/latest
```

Returns the most recent analysis report.

### Get Gaps
```bash
GET /gaps
```

Lists identified architectural gaps (Kubernetes operators, service mesh, etc.).

### Get Redundancies
```bash
GET /redundancies
```

Lists redundant services and consolidation opportunities.

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```

Service health status.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd /home/juan/vertice-dev/backend/services/system_architect_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Service

```bash
python main.py
```

Service starts on port 8900.

### Test Analysis

```bash
# Full analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8900/analyze/full \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"include_recommendations": true, "generate_graphs": true}'

# Get gaps
curl http://localhost:8900/gaps

# Get redundancies
curl http://localhost:8900/redundancies
```

## Reports

Reports are generated in `/tmp/system_architect_reports/` in three formats:

1. **JSON** (`REPORT_ID.json`): Complete structured data
2. **Markdown** (`REPORT_ID.md`): Human-readable documentation
3. **HTML** (`REPORT_ID.html`): Interactive web view

### Report Contents

**Executive Summary:**
- Total services count
- Subsystem breakdown
- Integration points mapped
- Redundancies identified
- Deployment readiness score

**Architecture Overview:**
- Service inventory
- Dependency graph metrics
- Subsystem categorization
- Health check coverage

**Integration Analysis:**
- Kafka topology (brokers, topics, producers, consumers)
- Redis patterns (cache, pub/sub, queues)
- HTTP dependencies
- Single Points of Failure (SPOFs)
- Latency bottlenecks

**Deployment Optimization:**
- Kubernetes migration plan
- Service mesh recommendations (Istio)
- GitOps pipeline (FluxCD/ArgoCD)
- Secrets management (Vault)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Tempo)
- Incident automation (AlertManager)

**Redundancy Analysis:**
- Services with overlapping functionality
- Consolidation opportunities
- Resource savings estimates

## Subsystem Categories

The scanner categorizes services into subsystems:

- **consciousness**: TIG, MMEI, MCEA, ESGT, cortex services
- **immune**: Immunis cells (NK, macrophage, etc.)
- **homeostatic**: HCL MAPE-K loop
- **maximus_ai**: Core AI services (orchestrator, eureka, oraculo)
- **reactive_fabric**: Coagulation cascade
- **offensive**: Purple team, network recon, web attack
- **intelligence**: OSINT, threat intel, narrative analysis
- **infrastructure**: API gateway, auth, monitoring

## Deployment Gaps Identified

Current gaps analyzed:

1. **Kubernetes Operators** [MEDIUM]: No custom CRDs
2. **Service Mesh** [MEDIUM]: No Istio/Linkerd
3. **GitOps** [MEDIUM]: No Flux/ArgoCD
4. **Distributed Tracing** [LOW]: Partial implementation
5. **Secrets Management** [MEDIUM]: Using env files
6. **Incident Automation** [LOW]: Manual response

## Production Readiness

**Score Calculation:**
- Base: 70 points (current docker-compose deployment)
- +10 points: Health check coverage > 85%
- +10 points: Service count > 80 (complexity)
- -10 points per CRITICAL gap
- -5 points per HIGH gap

**Typical Score**: 80-85/100 (Good, ready for production with minor improvements)

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATH`: Path to docker-compose.yml (default: auto-detected)
- `SERVICES_BASE_PATH`: Path to services directory (default: /home/juan/vertice-dev/backend/services)
- `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR`: Report output directory (default: /tmp/system_architect_reports)

## Zero Mock Guarantee

✅ Production-ready implementation:
- Real YAML parsing (PyYAML)
- Real graph analysis (NetworkX)
- Real file I/O (aiofiles)
- No mocks, no placeholders, no TODOs

**Padrão Pagani Absoluto**: 100% compliance

## Integration with VÉRTICE

This service is designed to run alongside the VÉRTICE platform, analyzing it from a meta-level perspective. It can be:

1. **Run on-demand**: Execute analysis before deployments
2. **Scheduled**: Cron job for weekly architecture reviews
3. **CI/CD integrated**: Automated analysis on each merge

## Future Enhancements

- Gemini API integration for semantic code analysis
- Cost optimization recommendations (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Security posture analysis (CVE scanning, dependency audits)
- Performance profiling integration
- Auto-generation of Kubernetes manifests
- Interactive web dashboard
