"""Maximus Threat Intelligence Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Threat Intelligence
Service. It initializes and configures the FastAPI application, sets up event
handlers for startup and shutdown, and defines the API endpoints for gathering,
processing, and disseminating actionable threat intelligence.

It orchestrates the integration with external Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)
and feeds, analyzes raw threat data to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs),
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and threat actor profiles. This
service is crucial for enriching internal security events with relevant threat
context and providing real-time threat intelligence to other Maximus AI services.
