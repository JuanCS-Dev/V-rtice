"""Maximus Vestibular Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Vestibular
Service. Inspired by the biological vestibular system, this service is responsible
for maintaining the AI's sense of balance, spatial orientation, and self-motion
perception within its operational environment.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Ingesting data from simulated accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other motion sensors.
- Processing and integrating motion data to determine orientation and movement.
- Detecting changes in velocity, acceleration, and angular position.
- Providing real-time spatial awareness and motion cues to other Maximus AI
  services for navigation, physical interaction, and stability control.
