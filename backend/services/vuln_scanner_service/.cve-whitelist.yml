  # h11 - Request Smuggling Vulnerability
  - id: CVE-2025-43859
    package: h11==0.14.0
    cvss: 7.5
    severity: HIGH
    justification: |
      h11 0.14.0 has a request smuggling vulnerability via lenient line terminator parsing.

      DEPENDENCY CONFLICT: Cannot upgrade to h11>=0.16.0 due to httpcore dependency constraint.
      httpcore 1.0.8 requires h11<0.15,>=0.13 - resolution impossible without major httpx/httpcore upgrade.

      MITIGATIONS IN PLACE:
      - Vuln scanner service runs in controlled environment (internal scanning only)
      - Service initiates HTTP requests (client mode), not a server receiving external requests
      - All scanned targets are internal/trusted infrastructure
      - Network segmentation prevents external exploitation
      - Request validation at API gateway level

      ATTACK SURFACE: This CVE affects HTTP servers receiving malformed requests. Our service is an HTTP CLIENT that sends requests to scan targets. Risk is minimal as we control both endpoints.

      PLANNED REMEDIATION: Monitor for httpcore/httpx updates supporting h11>=0.16.0. Quarterly review to check for compatible versions.

      Reference: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43859

    mitigations:
      - "HTTP client mode (not server - minimal attack surface)"
      - "Internal scanning targets only (no external exposure)"
      - "Network segmentation (isolated subnet)"
      - "API Gateway with request validation"
      - "Controlled environment"

  # h11 - Side-channel Attack (GHSA duplicate)
  - id: GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj
    package: h11==0.14.0
    cvss: 7.5
    severity: HIGH
    justification: |
      Duplicate entry for h11 request smuggling (same as CVE-2025-43859). Same dependency conflict with httpcore 1.0.8 requiring h11<0.15. Same mitigations apply.

    mitigations:
      - "HTTP client mode (not server)"
      - "Internal scanning only"
      - "Network segmentation"
