"""Maximus Vulnerability Scanner Service - Package Initialization.

This package provides the core functionality for the Maximus AI's Vulnerability
Scanner Service. It is responsible for actively scanning target systems and
applications to identify security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and known
vulnerabilities.

Key components within this package are responsible for:
- Integrating with external vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, custom scripts).
- Orchestrating various types of vulnerability scans (e.g., network, web application, host-based).
- Analyzing scan results and correlating them with threat intelligence.
- Providing detailed vulnerability reports to other Maximus AI services for
  risk assessment, patch management, and proactive defense.
