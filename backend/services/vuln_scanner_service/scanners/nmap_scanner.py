"""Maximus Vulnerability Scanner Service - Nmap Scanner.

This module implements an Nmap Scanner for the Maximus AI's Vulnerability
Scanner Service. It acts as a wrapper around the Nmap (Network Mapper) utility,
enabling Maximus to perform network-based vulnerability assessments.

Key functionalities include:
- Executing Nmap scans with various options (e.g., service detection, OS detection, script scanning).
- Parsing Nmap's XML output to extract host information, open ports, and identified services.
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities based on service versions or known misconfigurations.
- Providing structured scan results for further analysis and correlation with
  vulnerability intelligence.

This scanner is crucial for discovering network-level weaknesses, mapping the
attack surface, and supporting proactive defense strategies within the Maximus
AI system.
