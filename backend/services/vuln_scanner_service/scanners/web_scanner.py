"""Maximus Vulnerability Scanner Service - Web Scanner.

This module implements a Web Scanner for the Maximus AI's Vulnerability
Scanner Service. It is designed to perform web application vulnerability
assessments, identifying common web-based security flaws such as SQL injection,
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations.

Key functionalities include:
- Crawling web applications to discover pages and parameters.
- Injecting payloads to test for various web vulnerabilities.
- Analyzing HTTP responses for error messages or unexpected behavior.
- Identifying outdated web technologies or insecure headers.
- Providing structured scan results for further analysis and correlation with
  vulnerability intelligence.

This scanner is crucial for securing web-facing applications, protecting against
common web attack vectors, and supporting proactive defense strategies within
the Maximus AI system.
