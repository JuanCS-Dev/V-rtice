# 🧠 Natural Language Parser for vCLI-Go

**Status**: Planning Complete ✅ | Ready for Implementation  
**Effort**: 10 weeks (5 sprints) | Confidence: HIGH

**Lead Architect**: Juan Carlos (Inspiration: Jesus Christ)  
**Co-Author**: Claude (MAXIMUS AI Assistant)

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We're implementing a **production-grade natural language parser** for vcli-go that allows users to speak naturally in Portuguese or English and have their intent translated to precise commands. This is NOT a prototype—it's a sophisticated NLP system comparable to GitHub Copilot CLI's parser, with **enterprise-grade Zero Trust security**.

### Critical Innovation: "O Guardião da Intenção" v2.0

During planning review, **Juan Carlos identified** that Natural Language Parser without Zero Trust transforms any user into a "super-hacker." His security-first insight led to the formalization of a **7-layer Zero Trust architecture** that makes this the only NLP CLI with enterprise-grade security.

### User Experience Goal
```bash
# Instead of this:
┃ k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running

# Users can say this:
┃ mostra os pods com problema no prod

🧠 Understood: Show problematic pods in prod namespace
🔐 Verifying: MFA ✓ | Authorization ✓ | Risk Assessment ✓
📋 Executing: k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlight

```
User Input (NL) → 🛡️ 7-Layer Security Wrapper → NLP Pipeline → Execution

Security Layers:
1️⃣  Autenticação (MFA + Crypto)
2️⃣  Autorização (RBAC + Context)
3️⃣  Sandboxing (Least Privilege)
4️⃣  Validação Intenção (HITL + Sign)
5️⃣  Controle Fluxo (Rate Limit)
6️⃣  Análise Comportamental (Anomaly)
7️⃣  Auditoria Imutável (Blockchain)
```

### Core Components
1. **Tokenizer** - Text → Structured tokens
2. **Intent Classifier** - Tokens → User intent
3. **Entity Extractor** - Tokens → Structured data
4. **Command Generator** - Intent + Entities → vcli command
5. **Context Manager** - Conversational memory
6. **Learning Engine** - Adaptation from feedback
7. **Validator** - Command validation & suggestions

**ALL wrapped in Zero Trust security layers.**

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Implementers)

### Read First
```bash
# 1. Understand authorship and credits
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/.credits.md

# 2. Understand the security vision
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/nlp-zero-trust-security.md

# 3. Check the architecture
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/natural-language-parser-blueprint.md

# 4. Review the timeline
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/nlp-implementation-roadmap.md

# 5. See the code plan
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/nlp-implementation-plan.md
```

### Begin Implementation
```bash
cd /home/juan/vertice-dev/vcli-go

# Create package structure
mkdir -p internal/nlp/{tokenizer,intent,entities,context,generator,validator,learning}
mkdir -p internal/security/{auth,authz,sandbox,intent_validation,flow_control,behavioral,audit}
mkdir -p pkg/nlp

# Follow Implementation Plan Day 1
# Copy type definitions from plan
# Begin tokenizer implementation
```

## 💡 Example Usage Patterns

### Simple Queries
```
"mostra os pods"                  → k8s get pods
"lista deployments"               → k8s get deployments
"show me the services"            → k8s get services
```

### With Security Verification
```
"deleta todos os pods de prod"

🔐 Verifying identity...
   ✓ MFA confirmed
   ✓ Session valid

⚠️  CRITICAL ACTION DETECTED
   Risk Level: CRITICAL 🔴
   
   Requires:
   1. Explicit confirmation
   2. MFA re-verification
   3. Cryptographic signature
   4. Manager approval

[Security flow completes]

✅ All 7 security layers passed
📋 Executing: k8s delete pods --all -n production
```

---

## 🛡️ Security-First Design

This is **NOT just an NLP feature**. Security is **CORE ARCHITECTURE**.

**Why?** Juan Carlos's insight: "Natural Language Parser sem Zero Trust transforma qualquer usuário em super-hacker."

**Solution**: 7 layers of verification ensure every command passes through authentication, authorization, sandboxing, intent validation, flow control, behavioral analysis, and immutable audit.

See **[nlp-zero-trust-security.md](./nlp-zero-trust-security.md)** for complete details.

## 🎨 User Experience

### Clear Interpretation
Every NL command shows what was understood:
```
┃ pods com problema no prod

🧠 Understood: Show failed pods in prod namespace
🔐 Security: All checks passed
📋 Executing: k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase=Failed
```

### Intelligent Security
System adapts security requirements based on:
- Action risk level (LOW → CRITICAL)
- User behavior patterns
- Time and location context
- System state

Low-risk queries execute immediately. High-risk actions require multiple verifications.
