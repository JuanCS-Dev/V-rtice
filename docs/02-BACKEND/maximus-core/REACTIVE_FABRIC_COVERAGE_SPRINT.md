## Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Targeted approach**: Focusing on specific uncovered lines (from HTML coverage report) was highly effective
2. **Iterative testing**: Running coverage after each test file allowed quick course correction
3. **Public interface testing**: Testing through public methods (not private) improved test maintainability
4. **Mock simplicity**: Simple mocks were sufficient; complex test fixtures not needed

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Private method testing**: Initially tried to test private methods (_generate_esgt_events), switched to testing through public interface (collect_events)
2. **Event types**: Had to fix EventType enum usage (SYSTEM_STATE doesn't exist, used SYSTEM_HEALTH)
3. **Async complexity**: Some integration tests timeout due to async fixture overhead; unit tests run quickly

### Best Practices Applied

1. **One test per uncovered path**: Each test targeted 1-3 specific uncovered lines
2. **Descriptive test names**: All tests clearly describe what path they cover
3. **Minimal mocks**: Used only necessary mocks, avoided over-mocking
4. **Assert meaningfully**: Tests verify actual behavior, not just "doesn't crash"
