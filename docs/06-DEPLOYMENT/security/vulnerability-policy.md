# Vulnerability Management Policy 🔒

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11  
**Owner**: Security Team

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines the policy and procedures for managing vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the Vértice Platform.

---

## 📋 Scope

This policy covers:
- Python dependencies (pip packages)
- NPM dependencies (Node.js packages)
- Docker base images
- System libraries
- Third-party APIs and services

---

## 🔍 Vulnerability Scanning

### Automated Scanning

**Frequency**:
- Daily automated scans (2 AM UTC)
- On every push to main/develop
- On every pull request
- On-demand via workflow dispatch

**Tools**:
- **Python**: Safety (PyUp.io vulnerability database)
- **NPM**: npm audit (npm vulnerability database)
- **Containers**: Trivy (Aqua Security)

**GitHub Actions**:
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- Runs automatically on schedule and code changes

### Manual Scanning

**Command**:
```bash
cd /path/to/vertice-dev
./scripts/security/scan-vulnerabilities.sh --all
```

**Options**:
- `--python`: Scan Python dependencies only
- `--npm`: Scan NPM dependencies only
- `--all`: Scan all dependencies (default)
- `--fix`: Attempt automatic fixes

## 🚨 Severity Levels

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0) 🔴
- **Action Required**: IMMEDIATE (within 24 hours)
- **Response**: Patch, upgrade, or mitigate immediately
- **Escalation**: Notify security team and CTO
- **Deployment**: Emergency patch deployment authorized

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9) 🟠
- **Action Required**: URGENT (within 7 days)
- **Response**: Plan patch or upgrade within sprint
- **Escalation**: Notify security team
- **Deployment**: Include in next release

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9) 🟡
- **Action Required**: TIMELY (within 30 days)
- **Response**: Schedule fix in backlog
- **Escalation**: Add to security board
- **Deployment**: Next minor version

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9) 🟢
- **Action Required**: ROUTINE (within 90 days)
- **Response**: Fix during maintenance
- **Escalation**: Track in backlog
- **Deployment**: Next major version

## 🔧 Remediation Procedures

### Step 1: Triage (within 2 hours)
1. Review vulnerability report
2. Assess severity (CVSS score)
3. Determine exploitability
4. Identify affected services
5. Assign severity level

### Step 2: Investigation (within 24 hours)
1. Verify vulnerability is exploitable in our context
2. Check if dependency is actually used
3. Identify fixed version or workaround
4. Assess impact of upgrade (breaking changes)

### Step 3: Remediation (based on severity)
**Option A: Upgrade Dependency**
```bash
# Python
pip install --upgrade <package>
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# NPM
npm update <package>
npm audit fix
```

**Option B: Patch/Workaround**
- Apply vendor patch if available
- Implement code-level mitigation
- Isolate vulnerable component

**Option C: Accept Risk (documented)**
- Vulnerability not exploitable in our context
- No fix available, mitigations in place
- Document risk acceptance in JIRA ticket

### Step 4: Testing
1. Run full test suite
2. Security regression tests
3. Manual verification
4. Staging environment deployment

### Step 5: Deployment
1. Create release notes
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor for issues
4. Update vulnerability tracking
