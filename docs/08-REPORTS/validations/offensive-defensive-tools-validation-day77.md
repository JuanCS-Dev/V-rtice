## 📋 GAPS & BACKLOG (Non-Blocking)

### 🟡 Minor Gaps
1. **Recon Tools Tests** (scanner.py, dns_enum.py)
   - Impact: Low (tools functional, just need test formalization)
   - Timeline: Can be addressed post-workflow integration

2. **Encrypted Traffic Analyzer** (optional tool)
   - Impact: None (nice-to-have, not in critical path)

### ⚪ Future Enhancements
- Payload obfuscation level 4 (APT-grade)
- WebSocket streaming for long-running ops
- STIX/TAXII threat intel integration
