## 🎯 Phase Principles

### "No Phase Left Behind"
- ✅ Every started phase is completed
- ✅ No abandoned work
- ✅ Clear success criteria
- ✅ Validated completion

### Quality Gates
Each phase must pass:
1. **Syntactic Validation** - Code quality, tests passing
2. **Semantic Validation** - Integration working
3. **Phenomenological Validation** - Consciousness metrics improved

### Documentation Standards
Every phase includes:
- Clear objectives and scope
- Success criteria
- Implementation details
- Validation results
- Lessons learned
