malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36159,"date":"2025-10-07"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.10","1.21.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.20.10","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.21.3","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11250000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39325","versionConstraint":">=

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36159,"date":"2025-10-07"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.10","1.21.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.20.10","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.21.3","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11250000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39325","versionConstraint":">= 1.20.0, < 1.20.10,>= 1.21.0, < 1.21.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.20.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"afadbd100c9cd0c4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/kubectl","accessPath":"/bin/kubectl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.20.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.20.5","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p782-xgp4-8hr8","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"golang.org/x/sys/unix has Incorrect privilege reporting in syscall","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29526","epss":0.00173,"percentile":0.39134,"date":"2025-10-07"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad","date":"2023-02-26","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.08909500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-29526","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29526","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/","https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52313","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Y5qrqw_lWdU","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q6GE5EQGE4L2KRVGW4T75QVIYAXCLO5X/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQXU752ALW53OJAF5MG3WMR5CCZVLWW6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55VUVGO7E5PJFXIOVAY373NZRHBNCI5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0001/"],"description":"Go before 1.17.10 and 1.18.x before 1.18.2 has Incorrect Privilege Assignment.

On Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b.

The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39326","epss":0.00048,"percentile":0.14458,"date":"2025-10-07"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.12","1.21.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.20.12","date":"2023-12-13","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.21.5","date":"2023-12-13","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02472},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39326","versionConstraint":"< 1.20.12,>= 1.21.0-0, < 1.21.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.20.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"afadbd100c9cd0c4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/kubectl","accessPath":"/bin/kubectl","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.20.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.20.5","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-vv39-3w5q-974q","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vv39-3w5q-974q","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Kubernetes allows Command Injection affecting Windows nodes via nodes/*/logs/query API","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9042","epss":0.00045,"percentile":0.13492,"date":"2025-10-07"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.29.13"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.29.13","date":"2025-03-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.024525},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-9042","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9042","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/129654","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/9C3vn6aCSVg","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/16/1"],"description":"This CVE affects only Windows worker nodes.
