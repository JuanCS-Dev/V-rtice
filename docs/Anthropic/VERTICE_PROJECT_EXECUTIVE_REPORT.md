## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical AI Implementation

### Multi-Framework Decision System

Every autonomous action undergoes evaluation by **4 independent ethical frameworks** running in parallel:

**Decision Flow:**
```
Threat Detected
    ‚Üì
[Parallel Execution]
    ‚îú‚îÄ Kantian Check (can veto)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Consequentialist Analysis
    ‚îú‚îÄ Virtue Ethics Assessment
    ‚îî‚îÄ Principialism Evaluation
    ‚Üì
Aggregate Results (weighted)
    ‚Üì
Decision Logic:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Score ‚â• 0.75 & Agreement ‚â• 75% ‚Üí APPROVED
    ‚îú‚îÄ Score < 0.40 ‚Üí REJECTED
    ‚îî‚îÄ Ambiguous ‚Üí ESCALATE TO HUMAN
