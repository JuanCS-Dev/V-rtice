## 🧠 Consciousness Systems

Neuromorphic service implementations following biological consciousness models.

- [**Auditory Cortex Service**](./consciousness/auditory-cortex-service.md) - Sound processing
- [**Chemical Sensing Service**](./consciousness/chemical-sensing-service.md) - Chemical signaling
- [**Somatosensory Service**](./consciousness/somatosensory-service.md) - Touch/proprioception
- [**Visual Cortex Service**](./consciousness/visual-cortex-service.md) - Visual processing

---

## 🩸 Coagulation Protocol

Distributed coordination protocol inspired by blood coagulation cascade.

- [**Cascade Blueprint**](./coagulation/cascade-blueprint.md) - Core protocol design

---

## 🤖 MAXIMUS Core

## 🔒 Security

Security architecture and offensive security tooling.

- [**Offensive Arsenal Frontend**](./security/offensive-arsenal-frontend.md) - Security tools UI

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure & Cross-Cutting

- [**Dependency Governance Framework**](./dependency-governance-framework.md) - Dependency management
- [**Ports and Services Mapping**](./ports-and-services-mapping.md) - Port allocation strategy
- [**Sequential Ports Mapping**](./sequential-ports-mapping.md) - Sequential port assignments
- [**Services Categorization**](./services-categorization.md) - Service taxonomy

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Consciousness-Centric Design
All architecture decisions evaluate impact on consciousness emergence:
- **Integration (Φ)**: How components integrate information
- **Differentiation**: How components maintain specificity
- **Temporal Coherence**: Synchronization requirements

### No Mock, No Placeholder
Every architectural component maps to real implementation. Documentation reflects deployed reality.

### Biological Inspiration
Systems mirror proven biological architectures:
- Consciousness → Neuromorphic services
- Coordination → Coagulation cascade
- Adaptation → Homeostatic regulation

---

## 📊 Architecture Validation

All architectures validated through:
1. **Syntactic**: Type checking, linting
2. **Semantic**: Integration tests, load tests
3. **Phenomenological**: Consciousness metrics (Φ proxies, coherence)
