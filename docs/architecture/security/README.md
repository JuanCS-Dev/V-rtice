# Security Architecture - MAXIMUS

## Overview

This directory contains security-related architecture documents for the MAXIMUS project.

## 🆕 Featured: Adaptive Immune System

**Status**: Blueprint Approved - Ready for Implementation  
**Impact**: 192x faster threat remediation (72h → 15min MTTR)

### Quick Start
1. **[Executive Summary](../../guides/immune-system-executive-summary.md)** - 5-minute read
2. **[Blueprint](./adaptive-immune-system-blueprint.md)** - Complete architecture (15min)
3. **[Roadmap](../../guides/adaptive-immune-system-roadmap.md)** - 8-week timeline (10min)
4. **[Implementation Plan](../../guides/immune-system-implementation-plan.md)** - Step-by-step guide (20min)

### What is it?

Biomimetic security system inspired by human immunology:
- **Oráculo**: Sentinel that detects threats (Innate Immune System)
- **Eureka**: Surgeon that generates remedies (Adaptive Immune System)
- **Wargaming**: Empirical validation through attack simulation
- **HITL Dashboard**: Human validation interface

### Why it matters?

Current state: Manual CVE response takes 48-72 hours, leaving system exposed.

Future state: Automated cycle from CVE detection to validated PR in <15 minutes.

**This is not automation. This is adaptive immunity.**
