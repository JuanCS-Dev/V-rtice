# 🧠 Natural Language Parser for vCLI-Go

**Status**: Planning Complete ✅ | Ready for Implementation  
**Effort**: 8 weeks (4 sprints) | Confidence: HIGH

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We're implementing a **production-grade natural language parser** for vcli-go that allows users to speak naturally in Portuguese or English and have their intent translated to precise commands. This is NOT a prototype—it's a sophisticated NLP system comparable to GitHub Copilot CLI's parser.

### User Experience Goal
```bash
# Instead of this:
┃ k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running

# Users can say this:
┃ mostra os pods com problema no prod

🧠 Understood: Show problematic pods in prod namespace
📋 Executing: k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlight

```
User Input → Tokenizer → Intent Classifier → Entity Extractor
                                    ↓
            Command ← Generator ← Context Manager
                ↓
            Validator → Executor
                ↓
            Feedback → Learning Engine → Improved Parsing
```

### Core Components
1. **Tokenizer** - Text → Structured tokens
2. **Intent Classifier** - Tokens → User intent
3. **Entity Extractor** - Tokens → Structured data
4. **Command Generator** - Intent + Entities → vcli command
5. **Context Manager** - Conversational memory
6. **Learning Engine** - Adaptation from feedback
7. **Validator** - Command validation & suggestions

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Implementers)

### Read First
```bash
# 1. Understand the vision
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/natural-language-parser-blueprint.md

# 2. Check the timeline
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/nlp-implementation-roadmap.md

# 3. See the code plan
cat docs/architecture/vcli-go/nlp-implementation-plan.md
```

### Begin Implementation
```bash
cd /home/juan/vertice-dev/vcli-go

# Create package structure
mkdir -p internal/nlp/{tokenizer,intent,entities,context,generator,validator,learning}
mkdir -p pkg/nlp

# Follow Implementation Plan Day 1
# Copy type definitions from plan
# Begin tokenizer implementation
```

## 💡 Example Usage Patterns

### Simple Queries
```
"mostra os pods"                  → k8s get pods
"lista deployments"               → k8s get deployments
"show me the services"            → k8s get services
```

### With Filters
```
"pods com problema"               → k8s get pods --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
"deployments no namespace prod"   → k8s get deployments -n prod
"failed pods in staging"          → k8s get pods -n staging --field-selector=status.phase=Failed
```

### Actions
```
"escala nginx pra 5"              → k8s scale deployment/nginx --replicas=5
"deleta o pod nginx-abc"          → k8s delete pod nginx-abc
"aplica o config.yaml"            → k8s apply -f config.yaml
```

### Advanced
```
"mostra pods quebrados no prod nos últimos 30min"
→ k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running (with time filter)

"escala todos deployments com label app=api pra 3"
→ k8s scale deployments -l app=api --replicas=3
```

### Context-Aware
```
User: "mostra os pods"
vCLI: [shows pods]

User: "deleta o primeiro"
vCLI: [deletes first pod from previous list]
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Clear Interpretation
Every NL command shows what was understood:
```
┃ pods quebrados no prod

🧠 Understood: Show failed pods in prod namespace
📋 Executing: k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase=Failed
```

### Ambiguity Handling
```
┃ escala nginx

🤔 Multiple matches found:

1. deployment/nginx (3 replicas) in default
2. statefulset/nginx (2 replicas) in prod

Select [1/2] or clarify further ›
```

### Learning from Feedback
```
┃ pods quebrados

🧠 Understood: Show failed pods
📋 Executing: k8s get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Failed

[Output]

👍 Was this correct? [y/n] › y
✅ Thanks! I'll remember "quebrados" = failed status
```
