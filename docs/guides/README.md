## 📝 Guide Principles

### "Teaching by Example"
> Each guide demonstrates not just WHAT to do, but WHY and HOW.

### Quality Standards
All guides must:
- ✅ Explain the problem context
- ✅ Provide step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Include validation criteria
- ✅ Show expected outcomes
- ✅ Document lessons learned

### No Placeholders
Like our code:
- ❌ No "TODO" sections
- ❌ No incomplete procedures
- ✅ Every guide is actionable
- ✅ Every step is validated
