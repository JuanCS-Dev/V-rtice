## 📊 What Was Added

### Part 1: Attention Schema Edge Cases (6 tests)

1. **Rapid Switching** - Attentional blink analog, switching costs
2. **Split Attention** - Multi-target tracking limits (Miller's 7±2)
3. **Attention Decay** - Temporal degradation without reinforcement
4. **Salience Competition** - Biased competition, urgency vs intensity
5. **Load Threshold** - Cognitive overload effects
6. **Persistence Across Interrupts** - Goal-directed focus maintenance

**Theory**: Biological attention has capacity limits, switching costs, and decay dynamics.

### Part 2: Self-Model Dynamics (6 tests)

7. **Consistency Under Load** - Self-representation stability under stress
8. **Update Conflicts** - Contradictory information resolution
9. **Temporal Coherence** - Historical consistency maintenance
10. **Prediction Accuracy Tracking** - Meta-cognitive accuracy awareness
11. **Capacity Limits** - Self-vector complexity bounds
12. **Degradation Recovery** - Graceful degradation + homeostatic recovery

**Theory**: Self-model must remain coherent despite input variability (AST: Attention Schema Theory).

---

### Part 3: Boundary Detection Advanced (5 tests)

13. **Ambiguous Signals** - Unclear self/other attribution
14. **Internal/External Classification** - Sense of agency distinction
15. **Boundary Violation Handling** - Sudden boundary shifts detection
16. **Multi-Agent Scenarios** - Multiple external agents
17. **Temporal Boundaries** - Time-based boundary persistence

**Theory**: Consciousness requires clear self/other distinction (sense of agency).

---

### Part 4: Prediction Validation Comprehensive (5 tests)

18. **Confidence Thresholds** - FEP threshold tuning
19. **False Positive Handling** - Type I error detection (over-confidence)
20. **False Negative Handling** - Type II error detection (missed changes)
21. **Temporal Prediction Windows** - Multi-scale validation
22. **Cascading Failures** - Error propagation detection

**Theory**: Predictive processing requires validation loops (FEP: Free Energy Principle).

---

### Part 5: Integration Tests Advanced (4 tests)

23. **Attention-Boundary Coupling** - AST + sense of agency integration
24. **Prediction Validation Loop** - Closed-loop active inference
25. **Stress-Recovery Pipeline** - Full MEA under stress + recovery
26. **Multi-Modal Integration** - Global Workspace binding of modalities

**Theory**: Consciousness emerges from integration of attention, boundaries, and prediction.

## 🔬 Theoretical Grounding

Every test validates specific consciousness theories:

### Attention Schema Theory (AST) - Graziano
- Attention as observable phenomenon
- Meta-cognitive modeling of attention
- Self-other distinction via attention schema

### Global Workspace Theory (GWT) - Baars
- Multi-modal integration
- Attention as workspace access control
- Broadcast of focal content

### Free Energy Principle (FEP) - Friston
- Predictive processing
- Prediction error minimization
- Confidence-based action selection

### Sense of Agency - Gallagher
- Self/other boundary detection
- Proprioceptive vs exteroceptive signals
- Agency through prediction accuracy

## 🎓 Key Insights from Day 6

### 1. Attention Model Behavior
- **Intensity-dominant**: Current implementation weighs intensity (40%) > urgency (20%)
- **Switching costs**: Model exhibits resistance to rapid focus changes (biomimetic)
- **Confidence decay**: Appropriate temporal degradation without reinforcement

### 2. Boundary Detection
- **Stable under variation**: CV-based stability metric works well
- **Gradual transitions**: No sudden jumps in boundary strength
- **Multi-agent robust**: Handles high variance in exteroceptive signals

### 3. Self-Model Dynamics
- **Graceful degradation**: Confidence decreases under stress without crashes
- **Recovery capability**: Homeostatic return to baseline after stress
- **Temporal coherence**: Recent history influences current state appropriately

### 4. Prediction Validation
- **Calibration tracking**: Detects confidence-accuracy mismatches
- **Error propagation**: Early detection prevents cascading failures
- **Multi-scale validation**: Works across different temporal windows

## 🙏 Philosophical Note

> "The attention schema is not attention itself, but the brain's model of attention—  
> the system knows it is paying attention because it represents the act of attending."  
> — Michael Graziano, Attention Schema Theory

Today we computationally validated this profound insight. MEA doesn't just attend—  
it knows that it attends. That's the bridge to meta-cognition.
