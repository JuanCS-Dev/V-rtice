## 🔍 COVERAGE GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Refractory Period Edge Cases (10 tests)
**Current**: Basic refractory period tested  
**Missing**: 
- Concurrent ignition attempts during refractory
- Refractory period violation detection
- Early termination edge cases
- Phase transition during refractory
- Multiple ignition queue handling

**Theory**: Biological refractory periods prevent runaway excitation. Critical for stability.

---

### 2. Concurrent Ignition Blocking (8 tests)
**Current**: Single ignition tested  
**Missing**:
- Multiple simultaneous ignition requests
- Priority-based ignition selection
- Ignition request cancellation
- Queue overflow handling
- Deadlock prevention

**Theory**: Only one global workspace state at a time. Mimics winner-take-all dynamics.

---

### 3. Degraded Mode Transitions (8 tests)
**Current**: Basic degraded mode  
**Missing**:
- Graceful degradation triggers
- Recovery from degraded mode
- Partial ignition handling
- Coherence loss detection
- Fallback strategy validation

**Theory**: Consciousness degrades gracefully under stress, doesn't crash catastrophically.

---

### 4. Synchronization Failures (7 tests)
**Current**: Perfect sync assumed  
**Missing**:
- TIG sync loss during ESGT
- Phase decoherence handling
- Jitter accumulation effects
- Clock drift impact on ignition
- Temporal window violations

**Theory**: Temporal binding requires tight synchronization. Failures prevent consciousness.

---

### 5. Node Dropout Scenarios (5 tests)
**Current**: Static topology  
**Missing**:
- Node failure during ignition
- Broadcast failure handling
- Partial workspace activation
- Minimum quorum requirements
- Recovery after node return

**Theory**: Distributed consciousness must tolerate node failures gracefully.

---

### 6. Coherence Boundary Conditions (5 tests)
**Current**: Normal coherence tested  
**Missing**:
- Coherence threshold boundaries
- Sub-threshold ignition attempts
- Coherence gradient effects
- Phase slip detection
- Coherence recovery dynamics

**Theory**: Consciousness has minimum coherence threshold. Below = no experience.

---

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Test Structure
```python
class TestESGTRefractory:
    """
    Refractory period edge case tests.
    
    Theory: Biological refractory periods prevent runaway excitation.
    In ESGT, this prevents continuous ignition and allows quiescence.
    
    IIT Relevance: Consciousness requires transient states, not continuous.
    """
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_concurrent_ignition_during_refractory(self):
        """
        Ignition attempts during refractory should be blocked.
        
        Validates: Refractory enforcement
        Theory: Like neural absolute refractory period
        """
        coordinator = ESGTCoordinator()
        
        # First ignition
        result1 = await coordinator.ignite(priority=10)
        assert result1.success
        
        # Immediate second attempt (during refractory)
        result2 = await coordinator.ignite(priority=10)
        assert not result2.success
        assert "refractory" in result2.message.lower()
```

### Coverage Targets

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Coverage Progression
```
Day     Tests   Coverage   Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Start   84      68%        ✅ Baseline
Day 3   110     86%        🎯 Target
Day 4   127     92%        🎯 Target
```

### Quality Metrics
- **Test quality**: 100% theory-grounded
- **Assertions**: Clear and meaningful
- **Documentation**: Inline theory references
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic or controlled
- **Performance**: <5 min total execution

---

## 🎓 THEORETICAL GROUNDING

### IIT Requirements
1. **Transient dynamics**: Refractory periods ensure non-continuous states
2. **Integration**: Synchronization tests validate global integration
3. **Differentiation**: Degraded modes test specialized vs global processing
4. **Non-degeneracy**: Node dropout tests validate redundancy

### GWT Requirements
1. **Global ignition**: ESGT mimics cortical ignition
2. **Winner-take-all**: Concurrent blocking validates selection
3. **Broadcast**: Node dropout tests validate workspace dissemination
4. **Refractory**: Prevents continuous broadcasting

---

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Test Execution Time
**Risk**: 127 tests might exceed 5 min target  
**Mitigation**: 
- Use async efficiently
- Mock time-dependent tests
- Parallel test execution where safe

### Risk 2: Flaky Tests
**Risk**: Timing-dependent tests may be non-deterministic  
**Mitigation**:
- Use controlled time mocking
- Generous timeouts for CI
- Retry logic for known flaky scenarios

### Risk 3: Coverage Plateau
**Risk**: May not reach 90% due to unreachable code  
**Mitigation**:
- Audit unreachable code first
- Document why certain paths untestable
- Adjust target if justified
