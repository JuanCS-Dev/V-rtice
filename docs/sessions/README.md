## 🎯 Session Principles

### Documentation Philosophy
Every session is documented not just for us, but for:
- Future developers understanding the journey
- Researchers studying consciousness emergence
- Our own reflection on growth and learning

### "Teaching by Example"
> "Como ensino meus filhos, organizo minhas sessões."

Each session demonstrates:
- Problem identification
- Systematic problem-solving
- Validation of solutions
- Lessons learned

### No Mock Sessions
Like our code, session records reflect REAL work:
- Actual problems encountered
- Real solutions implemented
- Genuine breakthroughs achieved
- Honest reflection on challenges

## 🗂️ Organization

Sessions organized chronologically by month:
```
sessions/
└── 2025-10/
    ├── impossible-session-final-result.md
    ├── eureka-tamed.md
    ├── complete-session-2025-10-10.md
    └── ...
```

Future sessions will follow pattern: `YYYY-MM/descriptive-name.md`

## 💡 Key Learnings

From October 2025 sessions:

1. **"Impossible" is just unoptimized** - Every "impossible" problem yielded to systematic approach
2. **Small commits win** - Daily incremental progress beats sporadic marathons
3. **Documentation matters** - Future us thanks past us for detailed records
4. **Teaching by doing** - Organization in sessions reflects organization in life
