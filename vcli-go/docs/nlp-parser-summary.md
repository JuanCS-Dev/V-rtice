# 🧠 Natural Language Parser - Project Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE → READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Effort**: 8 weeks | Confidence: HIGH

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

A **production-grade natural language parser** that allows vcli-go users to speak naturally in Portuguese or English, with their intent intelligently translated to precise commands—comparable to GitHub Copilot CLI's parser.

**Not a prototype. Not a proof-of-concept. A REAL parser.**

## ✨ Key Features

### Multi-Language Support
- Portuguese (PT-BR) and English
- Natural phrasing: "mostra os pods com problema"
- Colloquialisms: "quebrado", "tá rodando", etc.

### Intelligent Understanding
- Intent classification (QUERY, ACTION, INVESTIGATE, etc.)
- Entity extraction (pods, namespaces, labels, numbers)
- Typo correction (Levenshtein distance)
- Context awareness (conversational memory)

### Learning & Adaptation
- Learns from user feedback
- Custom aliases ("quebrado" = "failed")
- Personalized recommendations
- Pattern mining

### Production Quality
- <50ms parsing latency
- ≥95% accuracy
- 90%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Input (NL)
    ↓
Tokenizer (normalize, correct typos)
    ↓
Intent Classifier (determine what user wants)
    ↓
Entity Extractor (extract resources, filters, values)
    ↓
Command Generator (create vcli command)
    ↓
Validator (check correctness, suggest)
    ↓
Executor (run command)
    ↓
Learning Engine (improve from feedback)
```

- Pattern mining
- Custom aliases
- Confidence tuning

### Sprint 4: Polish (Week 7-8)
- Performance optimization
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Tutorial mode
- Metrics & telemetry

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Simple
```
"mostra os pods" → k8s get pods
```

### With Filters
```
"pods com problema no prod" → k8s get pods -n prod --field-selector=status.phase!=Running
```

### Actions
```
"escala nginx pra 5" → k8s scale deployment/nginx --replicas=5
```

### Context-Aware
```
User: "mostra os pods"
vCLI: [shows pods]

User: "deleta o primeiro"
vCLI: [deletes first pod]
```
