For packages where the installed version appears newer than the latest on PyPI, it is recommended to investigate their origin (e.g., pre-releases, private index) and pin them to a specific, known-good version.",

  ],
  "notes": "The versioning for several key packages (typer, rich, cryptography) is unusual and suggests the use of pre-releases or a non-standard package source. This is a significant risk to the stability and security of the supply chain. The highest priority recommendation is to standardize on stable, official releases from PyPI and pin the versions in the `requirements.txt` file."
