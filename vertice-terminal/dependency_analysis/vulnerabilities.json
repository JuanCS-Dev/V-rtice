  "summary": "No critical vulnerabilities were automatically detected due to the lack of a security scanning tool. The analysis is based on a manual, best-effort search for known CVEs against the specified package versions. A proper, automated security scanner is highly recommended.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "package": "PyYAML",
      "version": "6.0.3",
      "cve_id": "CWE-502",
      "severity": "Info",
      "title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in PyYAML",
      "description": "PyYAML is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if `yaml.load()` is used with untrusted data. The codebase currently uses `yaml.safe_load()`, which mitigates this risk. This is not a direct vulnerability in the project but a note on the potential risk of the library itself.",
      "recommendation": "Continue to exclusively use `yaml.safe_load()` for all YAML parsing. Never use `yaml.load()` on data from untrusted sources.",
      "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18342"]
    },
    {
      "package": "cryptography",
      "version": "46.0.2",
      "cve_id": "N/A",
      "severity": "Info",
      "title": "Potential for outdated cryptography primitives",
      "description": "Cryptography is a rapidly evolving field. While no specific CVEs were found for this version during the manual check, it is crucial to keep this library frequently updated to ensure the use of the latest and most secure cryptographic algorithms and primitives.",
      "recommendation": "Schedule regular checks (e.g., monthly) to update the `cryptography` package to its latest stable version.",
