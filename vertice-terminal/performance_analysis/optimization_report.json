      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Sequential Processing of Bulk Requests",
      "description": "The 'bulk' command iterates through a list of IPs and sends analysis requests one by one, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. This is extremely inefficient for a large number of IPs.",
      "complexity_before": "O(N), where N is the number of IPs. The total time is N * (average request time).",
      "complexity_after": "O(N), but the total time is closer to the time of the longest single request due to concurrency.",
      "recommendation": "Use `asyncio.gather` to execute all IP analysis requests concurrently. This will dramatically reduce the total execution time from a sum of all request times to the time of the single longest request.",
      "estimated_impact": "For 100 IPs with an average request time of 1 second, the execution time would drop from ~100 seconds to ~1-2 seconds."

      "line_number": 5,
      "type": "caching",
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Missing Cache Implementation",
      "description": "The entire caching system is a placeholder. The application makes repeated API calls for the same resources without caching the results, leading to poor performance and unnecessary network traffic.",
      "complexity_before": "Every resource fetch is an O(1) network call.",
      "complexity_after": "After the first fetch, subsequent accesses are O(1) local disk reads, which are orders of magnitude faster.",
      "recommendation": "Implement the `get`, `set`, and `clear` methods in the `Cache` class. Use the `diskcache` library, which is already a dependency, as it provides a simple, persistent, and thread-safe cache.",
      "estimated_impact": "Reduces latency for repeated queries from seconds to milliseconds and decreases API usage costs."

      "title": "Hardcoded HTTP Timeout",
      "description": "The HTTP client has a default timeout of 10 seconds. While having a timeout is good, it is not configurable.",
      "complexity_before": "N/A",
      "complexity_after": "N/A",
      "recommendation": "Make the timeout value configurable via the `config.yaml` file. This allows administrators to adjust the timeout based on network conditions and service-level agreements (SLAs).",
      "estimated_impact": "Improves reliability and allows for fine-tuning of performance in different network environments."

      "type": "io_optimization",
      "severity": "low",
      "title": "Use of Synchronous `time.sleep`",
      "description": "The mocked 'logs' command uses `time.sleep(0.5)`, which is a blocking call. In an application that uses asyncio, blocking calls should be avoided as they can freeze the entire event loop.",
      "complexity_before": "N/A",
      "complexity_after": "N/A",
      "recommendation": "Replace `time.sleep()` with `await asyncio.sleep()` to make the function non-blocking and cooperative with the asyncio event loop.",
      "estimated_impact": "Prevents the UI from becoming unresponsive, especially if this pattern is used in more complex, long-running commands."

      "severity": "low",
      "title": "Loading All File Analysis into Memory",
      "description": "The `analyze_all` function finds all python files and then loads the analysis of every single file into the `results` list before returning. For a very large project, this could consume a significant amount of memory.",
      "complexity_before": "Memory usage is O(M), where M is the total size of all analyzed code and ASTs.",
      "complexity_after": "Memory usage becomes O(1) with respect to the number of files.",
      "recommendation": "Change `analyze_all` to be a generator function that `yields` the analysis of each file one by one. This would allow the consumer of the function (like `DocumentationGenerator`) to process files in a streaming fashion, drastically reducing memory consumption.",
      "estimated_impact": "Significantly reduces the memory footprint when analyzing large codebases, preventing potential MemoryError exceptions."
