  SELECT process.name, process.pid, network.remote_ip, network.port
  FROM endpoints
  WHERE process.name IN ("psexec.exe", "wmic.exe", "sc.exe", "net.exe")
    AND network.port IN (135, 445, 3389, 5985, 5986)
  LIMIT 200

output_fields:
  - process.name
  - process.pid
  - network.remote_ip
  - network.port

remediation:
  - Immediately isolate source endpoint
  - Check destination endpoint for compromise
  - Reset credentials of affected accounts
  - Review authentication logs
  - Block lateral movement ports if not required
